Our high level approach is that we tried. We first gave a get to get us started and then we sent a post message to login. After that we parsed through the HTML and got all the links. After that we kept track of the links we had and visted and parsed them one by one, adding any NEW links to the list of links. We faced a lot of challenges, demstrated by the fact that it isn't finished. We first struggled to figure out the format of the GET message as well as lacking conceptual understanding. However, after we figured it out to some extent we struggled with sending a POST message. We didn't understand how to properly handle a 302 code. After finally figuring out how to redirect and figuring out how to parse the page, we realized we didn't even log in! We figured that out but time ran out. So one could say the whole thing was a challenge. We tried to test our code but then we would just get a new bug. We printed some stuff out as usual and found out what codes we were getting. But that debugging was just one step in the sea of bugs we had so we got a lot more testing to do.
